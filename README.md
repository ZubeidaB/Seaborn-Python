# Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn

Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn repository! This collection of scripts focuses on leveraging Seaborn to conduct visual data exploration. From identifying outliers and biases to creating insightful visualizations, these scripts cover a range of EDA techniques using Seaborn.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Line Plot Analysis

- **Line Plot:** Utilized Seaborn's `sns.lineplot` to visualize the relationship between Age and Weight in the dataset.

### 2. Outlier Detection

- **Boxplot for Age:** Employed Seaborn's `sns.boxplot` to identify potential outliers in the Age column.

### 3. Age Distribution Analysis

- **Distribution Plot for Age:** Used `sns.distplot` to explore the distribution of Age, providing insights into potential biases.

### 4. Multivariate Comparison

- **Pair Plot:** Conducted a comprehensive comparison of all columns with each other using Seaborn's `sns.pairplot`.

### 5. Correlation Analysis

- **Correlation Matrix:** Calculated the correlation between variables and created a heatmap using Seaborn's `sns.heatmap`.

### 6. Medal Count Visualization

- **Medal Count Bar Plot:** Visualized the distribution of Medals using Seaborn's `sns.countplot`.
